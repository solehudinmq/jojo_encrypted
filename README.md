# JojoEncrypted

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/jojo_encrypted`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jojo_encrypted'
```

Or you can do this
```ruby
gem 'jojo_encrypted', git: 'git@github.com:solehudinmq/jojo_encrypted.git', branch: 'master'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jojo_encrypted

## Usage

After that create this file in:

    $ config/jojo_encrypted.yml

With the contents of a file like this:

    $ SECRET_KEY_BASE: "xxxxxxx"
    $ ENCRYPTION_SERVICE_SALT: "xxxxxxx"

You can try the following steps to create a value from the .yml file:

  1. SECRET_KEY_BASE
    
    $ - irb
    $ - require 'active_support'
    $ - SecureRandom.random_bytes(
    $    ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor.key_len
    $  ) 
  2. ENCRYPTION_SERVICE_SALT

    $ - irb
    $ - require 'securerandom'
    $ - SecureRandom.hex(64)

In the model you have to do this to be able to encrypt the field ( for version 1 only support for integration with Mongoid gem ):

    $ include JojoEncrypted::Mongoid::AttrEncrypted
    $ encrypts :name, :phone

Model Example:

    $ class User
    $   include Mongoid::Document
  
    $   include JojoEncrypted::Mongoid::AttrEncrypted
    $   encrypts :name, :phone

    $   field :name, type: String
    $   field :phone, type: String
    $ end

How to get the value from the field:

    $ user = User.first
    $ user.name # rROxnMF4762NQnrF9w==--6BoWbXrvSFN85mv1--iCkdjRqHvc9vDPBVlEL/Xg==
    $ user.phone # C44p+IO6lk5wURYjrrCxmA==--ule6rHVOx/m29slx--L/AnfcGdredq+MbnNlRsjg==
    $ user.name_decrypted # jes
    $ user.phone_decrypted # 212121

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
